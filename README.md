# Birthday Reminder Service

## Overview
The **Birthday Reminder Service** is a scheduled background job that runs every hour to check if any users have a birthday at 9 AM in their respective timezones. If a userâ€™s birthday matches the current date and their local time is 9 AM, the worker sends them a birthday email and logs the process.

This worker is implemented using Node.js, MongoDB, and node-cron, ensuring reliable background job execution.

## Features
- Automatically checks for users with birthdays every hour.

- Sends a birthday email to users at 9 AM in their local timezone.

- Logs the process for debugging and monitoring.

- Includes error handling for missing data and system failures.
